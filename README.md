# PyVisComm
We have implemented two basic components of PyVisComm. 

This project contains two modules. File description:

1. libdmt module
The libdmt module implements auxiliary functions and the dmtphy class which is the central class associated 
with the physical layer of the DMT transmitter. The dmtphy class defines a set of attributes which reflect the parameters of the system. 

2. libimres module
The libimres module is used to calculate the impulse response of an optical wireless channel.
